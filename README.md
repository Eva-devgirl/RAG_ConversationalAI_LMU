# RAG_ConversationalAI_LMU
The RAG System is implemented by me for the Master Course Conversational AI at the centre for Information and Language Transformation (CIS) at the LMU University Munich. It is called MuenchenMenuGuide and the ambition is to find the best restaurants and cafes in the city for all tastes. LLAMA and BM25 are used for the implementation and NCDG, bleu, rouge, meteor the evaluation as well.
